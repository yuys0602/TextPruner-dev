"""
Simple check list from AllenNLP repo: https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/setup.py
To create the package for pypi.
1. Change the version in __init__.py, setup.py as well as docs/source/conf.py.
2. Commit these changes with the message: "Release: VERSION"
3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: "git tag VERSION -m'Adds tag VERSION for pypi' "
   Push the tag to git: git push --tags origin master
4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between
   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).
   For the wheel, run: "python setup.py bdist_wheel" in the top level directory.
   (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).
   For the sources, run: "python setup.py sdist"
   You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.
5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:
   twine upload dist/* -r pypitest
   (pypi suggest using twine as other methods upload files via plaintext.)
   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:
   pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi transformers
6. Upload the final version to actual pypi:
   twine upload dist/* -r pypi
7. Copy the release notes from RELEASE.md to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.
